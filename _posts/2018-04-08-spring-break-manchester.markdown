I was now headed out of Scotland and towards England. I did not know much about Manchester besides that a lot of people I knew in Ireland really liked it and told me to check it out if I had the chance. It took about 3 hours to get to Manchester from Edinburgh. As usual, on arrival I headed right away for my hostel and settled in.

I looked around town a bit and found a small market area with food vendors. I got a spicy burrito and looked around the square that was adjacent to the market.

I found more around town, including a memorial to Alan Turing and the old canal that helped Manchester become an important industrial city in the UK. At the end of the night I tried curry at a restaurant that was recommended to me by someone from the hostel. I wasn’t sure if I would like it but ended up enjoying it, but it was too much and I couldn’t finish the meal.

After getting a couple drinks a local bar I headed in for the night. The next day I was going to check out more specific sights in Manchester and take the sightseeing bus.

I didn’t get pictures on the actual bus  since it was hard to get a good shot from where I was seated, but we got to see many of the historic Manchester sites (mainly industrial) and the BBC studios located just outside of city centre. I also found a bunch of cool vintage shops that ended up bringing me to a strange mall called Afflecks that was full of local vendors. That night for dinner I found a restaurant that served special grilled cheese sandwiches (I tried a meatball marinara grilled cheese).

The last day I headed out and got some pictures of sights such as Manchester City Hall, which was impressive but being renovated at the time.

Now that my time in Manchester was over I headed out to the next English city: Liverpool.
