Over the past week I took a lot more pictures.

Saturday I went to Phoenix park. Its a big park kind of like Forest Park that has a zoo and other stuff in it. It was really beautiful. Most of what I saw was just fields and trees but I saw a horse racing track, some sort of memorial, and a restaurant called “the tea room” too. It let out right into the west part of City Centre.

Right outside of that I found the Courts of Criminal Justice. All the signage in Ireland has the text written in English and Gaelic.

The week before I saw Franz Ferdinand at the Olympia Theatre. It was a great show and a beautiful theatre but I didn’t take too many pictures during the show so I found some online.

Here are some other random pictures I have taken around Dublin. The old looking building with a clock is the Connolly train station. The building in the picture next to it is some Heineken building (they really like Heineken here). I tried to get pictures from the train but its hard to get a clear picture of the scenery while its moving. You can usually see mountains or hills is the distance. Romayo’s is one of the Irish chippers (kind of like fast food). Here they call Takeout “Takeaway”. Fast food delivery at these places is common and a service called “Just Eat” delivers from pretty much everywhere. If you go to the Just Eat website and search for places in Maynooth you’ll see most of the popular places. Sit down meals are not too popular at least among students.

Next week I’m hopefully traveling up North to Belfast with a group of international students. I’ll definitely take pictures of Northern Ireland, which is where they shoot Game of Thrones.
