I just finished by first week of lectures. The class size is bigger than I’m used to but not bad. I have my schedule figured out now, everything worked out except that I have to drop one class due to an overlap. I’ll be taking:

1. Personality and Intelligence (Psych)

2. Web Information Processing (Computer Science)

3. User Interface Design (Computer Science)

4. Audio and Speech Processing (Computer Science)

I’ll only have class on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday so I can take long weekends to travel once I have my immigration appointment, which is coming up in a few weeks.

This week I went out with my flatmates on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The only night people don’t normally go out is Tuesdays. The pubs are just a short walk from campus. We’re all adjusting to life in Ireland pretty well!

Not sure what I’ll be doing this weekend yet but if I do anything exciting I’ll make sure to take pictures!
