I started out my Spring Break trip by flying on a Ryanair flight from Dublin, Ireland to Glasgow, Scotland. The flight was so short we basically just got in the air and then went back down. Upon arriving in Glasgow I took a bus into town and then checked in to my hostel. I had a decent room with not much of a view, but a fine place to sleep.

After I checked in I explored town a bit and bought a lock so I could keep my luggage safe while I was away from the room. Hostels usually have lockers you can keep your things in so none of your roommates can go through your stuff.

I didn’t do much else that first day besides get food and some drinks at a bar. The second day I decided to check out a few different sights. First, the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse is an architecture museum in the middle of the city with a great view of the downtown from an old lighthouse. It took a bit of climbing but it was well worth it.

Next I took a train to Loch Lomond, a nearby lake. While it wasn’t the famous Loch Ness it was just as amazing, especially with the foggy weather. I found a good sightseeing spot in a small village where I also had dinner at a local cafe.

That about sums up what I saw in Glasgow. There wasn’t too much going on but a lot of beautiful things to see.

The next day, I was set to take a short train ride (about an hour) to the other big city in Scotland: Edinburgh.
