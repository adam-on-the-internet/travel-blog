# Leeds

Once I finished my semester, I flew to the UK for a couple concerts of a band I like, Sparks. The first concert was in Leeds where I actually got my own hotel room just down the street from the concert. I wasn’t here long but it was a nice city. It’s a small city where a lot of big concerts and events in the UK are held.

# London

I had a couple days in London again. This time I stayed in the Elephant and Castle area. I didn’t take many pictures since I already had London pictures but I took this picture of an area with a lot of local restaurants where I tried Ethiopian food.

The first day I went to see Sparks again in Northern London. The second day I went to a music festival in a park in Eastern London to see LCD Soundsystem. I was about ready to head back to Ireland, but I had one more city I wanted to see, Bristol.

# Bristol

I took a train ride to Bristol, the city I would fly out of to get back to Ireland. It was an interesting city based around docks. There was an interesting split in the town between the upper class area of the city and the hipster area that had a lot of street art, including a few works by Banksy. My airbnb here was in a nice area near the famous suspension bridge in Bristol.
