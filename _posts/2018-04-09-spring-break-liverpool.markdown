It was just a short train ride from Manchester to Liverpool. Since I only had one day in this city, I saw as much as I could right away. I was staying at a YHA hostel, which is one of the major hostel chains. They’re a nonprofit organization that has nice hostels. They stood out to me on the trip because there were lots of families and older people staying in these hostels since they were better organized. This hostel was slightly outside of city center but close to the docks.

After checking in and unpacking, I headed to the docks to check out The Beatles Experience museum. It was interesting but expensive and mostly just told the story I already knew. The docks were more fun, especially with the good weather. If I had more time I would’ve checked out more on the docks but instead I just went into the Tate Art Museum. After that, I moved in towards the city.

For dinner I googled the top restaurants in the area and found a popular Indian restaurant to try. They serve food similarly to how they serve at PF Chang’s, a lot of small dishes you order individually and share with everyone at the table. Since it was just me I just had two small dishes and rice. After a surprisingly good dinner I headed down to check out the famous Cavern Club. They have museum every day from the early hours til late and it only costed about 3 pounds (around 5 dollars) to go in. The club was far underground and packed, mainly with an older crowd. The band wasn’t amazing but they covered a few Beatles songs which was great to see in the venue. Around the club pictures of famous musicians who had performed there lined the walls.

I stayed for awhile in the club and then checked out the rest of the city.

There definitely would have been a lot more to see if I had more time, but I had to head out the next day so I just had a drink in an alternative themed pub and went back to the hostel. The next day I would have a long bus trip to the next stop: Cardiff, Wales.
