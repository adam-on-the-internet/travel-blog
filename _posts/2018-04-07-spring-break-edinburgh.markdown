After Glasgow, I took a one hour train ride to Edinburgh. I was surprised by how close the two cities were. My hostel was a short walk from the train station, but I had to go up a bunch of stairs since Edinburgh isn’t a flat city. All the buildings had a unique older style and there were a lot of interesting churches and monuments in every direction. The whole city felt like Hogwarts, apparently because this city inspired a lot of the scenery in the series. Victoria Street, a small quaint shopping area near my hostel, was the original Diagon Alley from the series. From right outside of my hostel there was a clear view of Edinburgh Castle.

With only one day in Edinburgh, I started to explore right away. I climbed up the hill and checked out the castle. From the castle there was a great view of the city. There was a lot to see in the castle but I tried to go through it as quickly as possible so I had time to see other things in the city.

My next stop was the peak of a group of hills in Edinburgh known as Arthur’s Seat. I had to walk through the city to reach Holyrood park and then walk about an hour up a trail to reach the peak.

After I made my way back down I got a quick dinner and headed back to the hostel. That night I went on a bar crawl the hostel had set up and got to meet people traveling from around the world, places such as the Philippines, Australia, and of course America.

I got decent sleep and explored a little more in the morning before taking the train to my next stop: Manchester.
