I did some more exploring around Maynooth the last couple days, here are some pictures of the campus and the town! Last night I went out with all of my flatmates to McMahon’s pub and had some drinks. Today is orientation all day, we’re getting a lot more information about campus and how classes will be when they start up next week.
