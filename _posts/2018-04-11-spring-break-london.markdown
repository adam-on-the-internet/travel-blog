The way from Victoria Coach bus station to my hostel was a long walk, but I got to see Buckingham Palace and a few other sights right away. London was way busier than any of the other cities I had visited.

After checking into my hostel, another YHA hostel like in Liverpool, I walked around a bit to see the what was around the hostel. I found the London Eye and the river.

Since I got there a little late and had a lot to see, I ended the first day sightseeing there. I decided with so much to see it would be best to take a free walking tour of the city. One left the hostel every morning at 10am. Unfortunately, it was a bit cold and rainy but it was still well worth the price. Although the tour was technically free at the end you’re supposed to tip the guide based on how good you felt the tour was. It took us past the royal sights, ending with Parliament and Big Ben which was under renovations. Subways running under it had shaken it to the point that it began to fall over and needed more supports.

A few of us from the tour got together afterwards and found an authentic English pub to have lunch in. It was a bit pricey but worth the experience. After a short break to recover from almost 3 hours of walking around London in the light rain, we met up again for dinner in China Town. We found a restaurant that served a multiple course meal for groups of two or more. We each got soup to start, then beef, chicken, rice, and vegetables for the main course (to share) and only had to pay 11 pounds a piece.

The next day I tried to cover as many other sights as I could. I saw Baker Street, where Sherlock Holmes lives in the stories, but didn’t take pictures because there was a long line with a Sherlock Holmes impersonator standing by the door. I moved on to explore Regent’s Park, one of London’s Royal Parks.

From here it was just a short walk to Abbey Road Studios where The Beatles famously recorded a lot of their music (as did a lot of other musicians). After this it started raining more so I headed back to the hostel.

There was a lot more in London I didn’t have a chance to see but it was spread out and a lot of it was time consuming and expensive (for instance the London Eye costs over 20 pounds to ride). I’ll see more when I go back with Eric in June. Next up was the last stop: Paris, France.
