Sunday evening I flew into Toronto, Canada from St. Louis. Our landing was a bit delayed due to fog, but that was not a problem since my next flight (to Dublin) was also a bit delayed. I got to take my time and have pizza and a beer at the airport.

On my flight to Dublin, I had no one next to me which made it easier to sleep. We landed in Dublin on time (around 10am here). From there, I went through immigration and customs and found the bus terminal. After a short wait I got on the bus to Maynooth. When the bus arrived, people from the university were at the station to walk with us up to the office where we would check in.

The weather was great, like a normal fall day in Missouri. I moved in to my apartment was and glad to find it bigger than expected. There are four bedrooms along a hallway that ends in a shared living space with a kitchen and sitting area.

I made a list of the things I needed and took a short walk to the shopping area to get things from Aldi and a store called Dunnes. Everything I need was pretty easy to find, but there was a much different selection than I was used to at the stores.

After moving in I walked around the town with one of my roommates and tried a Guinness at one of the pubs, the Clock House. After a few of those we walked back to the apartment and called it a night. Over the next few days Iâ€™m going to find out what else I need to get settled and explore more of the town!
